# 🎨 Simulation of Geometric Shapes in Vue.js

Welcome to my interactive simulation project, developed in **Vue.js**. In this project, geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles) fall due to gravity and respond to user interaction, allowing you to apply force to lift them.

## 🚀 Features

- **Gravity:** Geometric shapes fall from the top of the screen and stop when they hit the ground. 🌍
- **Dynamic Interaction:** By clicking and holding the mouse button, you can apply a force to lift the shapes. 🌟
- **Real-Time Force:** The applied force is calculated in real-time and capped at a maximum value. ⚙️
- **Attractive Design:** A force bar displays the intensity of the applied force. 🎨

## 🎯 Requirements
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **NPM/Yarn**: Included with Node.js

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repositorio.git` 
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    `cd tu-repositorio` 
    
3.  **Install the dependencies:**
